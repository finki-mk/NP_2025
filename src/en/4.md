## Auditory Exercise 4 (Working with arrays and sets, reading from SI, comparing using Comparable and Comparator)

#### 1. Book

Write a class for a book `Book` which stores: title, category, and price.

Implement a constructor with the following arguments: `Book(String title, String category, float price)`.

Then write a class `BookCollection` which stores a collection of books.
In this class, the following methods should be implemented:

* `public void addBook(Book book)` – adds a book to the collection
* `public void printByCategory(String category)` – prints all books from the given category (the string comparison should be case-insensitive), sorted by the book title (if the title is the same, sort by price).
* `public List<Book> getCheapestN(int n)` – returns a list of the N cheapest books (if there are fewer than N books in the collection, return all).

#### 2. Car

Write a class for a car `Car` which stores: manufacturer, model, price, and power.
Implement a constructor with the following arguments: `Car(String manufacturer, String model, int price, float power)`.

Then write a class `CarCollection` which stores a collection of cars.
In this class, the following methods should be implemented:

* `public void addCar(Car car)` – adds a car to the collection
* `public void sortByPrice(boolean ascending)` – sorts the collection by car price (in ascending order if the argument `ascending` is true, otherwise in descending order). If the car prices are the same, sorting should be done by their power.
* `public List<Car> filterByManufacturer(String manufacturer)` – returns a list of cars from a given manufacturer (the comparison is case-insensitive). The cars in this list should be sorted by model in ascending order.
* `public List<Car> getList()` – returns the list of cars from the collection.

#### 3. Race

Implement a class `F1Race` that reads from an input stream (standard input, file, etc.) data about the lap times of the last 3 laps for several F1 race drivers.
The data is in the following format:
`Driver_name lap1 lap2 lap3`,
where each `lap` is in the format `mm:ss:nnn`, where `mm` = minutes, `ss` = seconds, and `nnn` = milliseconds (thousandths of a second).

Example: `Vetel 1:55:523 1:54:987 1:56:134`.

Your task is to implement the following methods:

* `F1Race()` – default constructor
* `void readResults(InputStream inputStream)` – method for reading the data
* `void printSorted(OutputStream outputStream)` – method that prints all drivers sorted by their best time
  (the shortest time among their last 3 laps) in the format
  `Driver_name best_lap`, with 10 spaces for the driver’s name (left-aligned) and 10 spaces for the best lap time (right-aligned).
  The time should be printed in the same format as it was read.

**Solution**

#### 4. Weather

Implement a class `DailyTemperatures` that reads air temperatures (integer values) for different days of the year (numbers from 1 to 366).
The temperatures for one day are in one line in the following format (example):
`137 23C 15C 28C`.
The first number represents the day of the year, followed by an unknown number of temperature readings for that day, in either Celsius (C) or Fahrenheit (F).

In this class, implement the following methods:

* `DailyTemperatures()` – default constructor
* `void readTemperatures(InputStream inputStream)` – method for reading data from the input stream
* `void writeDailyStats(OutputStream outputStream, char scale)` – method for printing daily statistics
  (total measurements, minimum temperature, maximum temperature, average temperature) for each day, sorted in ascending order by day.
  The second argument `scale` determines in which scale the temperatures are printed:
  `C` – Celsius, `F` – Fahrenheit.
  The format for printing the statistics for a day is:
  `[day]: Count: [total measurements - 3 spaces] Min: [min temperature] Max: [max temperature] Avg: [average]`

The minimum, maximum, and average temperatures are printed with 6 characters in total, of which 2 are decimal places, followed by the temperature scale (C/F).

Conversion formulas:
From Celsius to Fahrenheit:  $\frac{T * 9}{5} + 32$
From Fahrenheit to Celsius:  $\frac{(T - 32) * 5}{9}$

**Note:** To achieve the same precision as in the reference results, for calculating the average and conversions between scales, temperatures should be stored as type `Double`.
